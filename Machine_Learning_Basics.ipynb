    "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building systems that learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, these systems improve their performance on a specific task over time with experience. Applications of machine learning are ubiquitous and include email filtering, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.\n"
